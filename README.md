# Turtle_Crossing

## Implementation of the turtle crossing game. Cars and a turtle are devised from the Python Turtle package. Cars are held in a CarManager class, which contains a list of Turtle cars.

## Once the turtle makes it to the other side of the road, a next level is reached, in which case the cars speed up and the turtle must try again.
